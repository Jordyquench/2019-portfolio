            <p>The showreel was something that I was tasked with doing to show clients what kind of work that origin could offer them.</p>

            <p>This was the first large motion graphic I have had to create, anything before this has only lasted around 5-10 seconds. I was looking forward to trying something on a larger scale. As I worked throught it I tried out a lot of different things, some worked and some didn't, but even some of the ones that worked didn't make the cut.</p>

            <p>Throughout the process there were a lot of changes before i ended up with what I have now. One of the harder parts were the 3d phones used for the case studies. I actually got some practice using 3d objects and cameras on a side project I was working on (If you want to see this, go to the <a class="rv" href="#" >rv animation case study</a>) </p>

            <p>Compared to the showreel this motion grpahic is a lot shorter. I took a pretty different approach to this one, I wanted to keep it nice and simple yet still have unique smooth animations.  </p>

            <p>This motion graphic was being used on for Linkenin, Twitter and Facebook, each had different dimensions but I just put the 1920 x 1080 version here. They all look the same except the twitter and Linkedin were more square while the Facebook was more like the one shown here. </p>

            <p>You may have seen versions of these on some billboards or on social media, but first thing I need to say is that I didn't create the illustrations, What I did on these were the animations. This was the first experience that I had with character animation, I know this isn't the most complex character animation but I was happy with the way they turned out.</p>

            <p>Looking back now I should have rigged the face so that I would have made it so much easier to animate but I didn't do that. I have since wanted to try some character rigging, it seemes like something that could be fun and a bit different. </p>

                    <p>These motion graphics were a bit different than the previous videos I did, these were more showing off products and trying to get certain information across. I know there are some more of these videos coming but for the time being it has just been these two.</p>

                    <p>I was trying to keep these as close to actual text messages as I could while still keeping the Danske style.

            <p>The brief for this project was basically to create a weather app, it was very wide open in terms of design freedom, so I wanted to take advantage of this.</p>

            <p>Once I started doing some research on weather apps I found they all were very boring an consisted of the same thing so I looked into getting an idea which was more out there. Eventually I started researching the weather on the other planets of the solar system and found it was so interesting so I tried to develop that idea more.</p>
